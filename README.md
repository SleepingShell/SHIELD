Shield is a development framework for circom developers but we plan it to other languages such as CAIRO, SNARKYJS etc.

The core reason is to provide libraries, plugins, and testing tools to ensure code quality and security.

Circomlib (which is the most popular library to build circom circuits) has over 1800 weekly downloads.

## Installation

Install shield globally with npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g @shield/cli
```
    
## Usage

```bash
$ shield init
```

Currently we are only providing the inialization feature in this CLI but we're working iteratively and working on other features as well that we have in our roadmap such as compilation and debugging with error stacktrace.
